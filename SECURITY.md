## Reporting a Vulnerability

The team and community take all security bugs in `tfinit` seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the [GitHub Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" feature](https://github.com/warike/terraform-files/security/advisories/new).

This will allow us to track and manage the vulnerability report privately.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much detail as possible, including:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The version of `tfinit` affected.
- Any potential impact of the vulnerability.

We will investigate all reports and do our best to fix the issue as quickly as possible. We'll keep you updated on our progress and will publicly acknowledge your contribution once the vulnerability is resolved.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
